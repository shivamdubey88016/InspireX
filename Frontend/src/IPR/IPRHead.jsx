            Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) refer to the legal protections
            granted to creators and inventors for their original works and
            inventions. These rights cover various types of creations, including
            patents for inventions, copyrights for literary and artistic works,
            trademarks for brand names and logos, and trade secrets for
            confidential business information. IPR helps safeguard the interests
            of creators by giving them exclusive rights to use, produce, and
            license their works, thus encouraging innovation and creativity.
            Enforcement of IPR ensures that unauthorized use or reproduction of
            protected works is prevented, maintaining the value and originality
            of intellectual creations.
